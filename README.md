By Using HTML & external CSS I was able to create a mock YouTube page which displays 12 videos with their thumbnail, title, video details and 
stats, and the channel's profile picture. 

There are only a few items that redirect you to a page when clicked on which are: video thumbnail, video title, creator's name, and the 
creator's profile picture. These four items take the user to the designated destination respectfully. Everything else on the screen that makes 
the mouse turn into a pointer is just there for effects such as the items along the header and the search bar.

This was my biggest project I have done yet using HTML & CSS. Also my first time being introduced to and using the div element.
